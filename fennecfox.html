                A Fennec Fox is a fox native to Northern Africa. It is most known for being the smallest species of fox and large ears which help it in hunting for prey. 
                They are part of the Canidae family which makes them closely related to Wolves and Dogs. These foxes have a lifespan anywhere from 10-15 years, weigh 1.5 - 5lbs, and come in just over 1 foot long. 
                Being native to Northern Africa, it has evolved to live off of small amounts of water for prolonged periods of time. They are capable of having two litters each year with each birthing 2-5 foxes each time.
