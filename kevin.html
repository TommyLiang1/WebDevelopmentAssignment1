<!-- Sea Lion -->

                A Sea Lion may often look friendly but they are a very interesting mammal. They have the ability to live for 20-30 years and often feast on Penguins and several types of fish.
                They typically weigh over 600+ lbs and are on average 8ft in length. Two of the most famous types of Sea Lions include the California Sea Lion and Steller Sea Lion. 
                In comparison to Seals, Sea lions are able to walk on land, whereas their counterparts are not. They are currently endangered and protected by the MMPA (Marine Mammal Protection Act).

    <h1>Fennec Fox</h1>
        <img src="img/fennecfox.jpg" alt="Fennec Fox" style="padding-top: 10px; width: 900px; height: 500px;"/>
            <p>
                A Fennec Fox is a fox native to Northern Africa. It is most known for being the smallest species of fox and large ears which help it in hunting for prey. 
                They are part of the Canidae family which makes them closely related to Wolves and Dogs. These foxes have a lifespan anywhere from 10-15 years, weigh 1.5 - 5lbs, and come in just over 1 foot long. 
                Being native to Northern Africa, it has evolved to live off of small amounts of water for prolonged periods of time. They are capable of having two litters each year with each birthing 2-5 foxes each time.

    <h1>Poison Dart Frog</h1>
        <img src="img/poisondartfrog.jpg" alt="Poison Dart Frog" style="padding-top: 10px; width: 900px; height: 500px;"/>
            <p>
                The Poison Dart Frog is a species of frog native to Central and Southern America. It is considered one of, if not the most dangerous species of amphibians in the world, hence its name. 
                They typically range anywhere from 0.5 to 1 inch and have the ability to live for 3-15 years. These frogs are extremely colorful, ranging from greens to reds to blues to any bright color imaginable. 
                In the past, poison darts were made from the toxins released by these frogs. These frogs also never seem to use their toxins for anything other than self defense, off-putting their predator or dying alongside them.
            </p>

<!-- Snowy Owl -->
    <h1>Snowy Owl</h1>
        <img src="img/snowyowl.jpg" alt="Snowy Owl" style="padding-top: 10px; width: 900px; height: 500px;"/>
            <p>
                These owls are known for their snow white color and yellow eyes. They are often found in extremely cold climates in Northern America and the Arctics. 
                These owls have the ability to live anywhere from 10 years in the wild and up to 30 years when tamed. 
                Snowy Owls weigh anywhere from 3.5 - 7lbs, have a wingspan ranging from 4 to 5 feet, and are on average 2 feet tall. They are able to fly at speeds up to 46mph, almost as fast as a Lion(50mph) and Horse(55mph).
