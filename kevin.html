                A Sea Lion may often look friendly but they are a very interesting mammal. They have the ability to live for 20-30 years and often feast on Penguins and several types of fish.
                They typically weigh over 600+ lbs and are on average 8ft in length. Two of the most famous types of Sea Lions include the California Sea Lion and Steller Sea Lion. 
                In comparison to Seals, Sea lions are able to walk on land, whereas their counterparts are not. They are currently endangered and protected by the MMPA (Marine Mammal Protection Act).

                A Fennec Fox is a fox native to Northern Africa. It is most known for being the smallest species of fox and large ears which help it in hunting for prey. 
                They are part of the Canidae family which makes them closely related to Wolves and Dogs. These foxes have a lifespan anywhere from 10-15 years, weigh 1.5 - 5lbs, and come in just over 1 foot long. 
                Being native to Northern Africa, it has evolved to live off of small amounts of water for prolonged periods of time. They are capable of having two litters each year with each birthing 2-5 foxes each time.
