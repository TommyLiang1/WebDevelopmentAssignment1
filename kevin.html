    <p>
        A Sea Lion may often look friendly but they are a very interesting mammal. They have the ability to live for 20-30 years and often feast on Penguins and several types of fish.
        They typically weigh over 600+ lbs and are on average 8ft in length. Two of the most famous types of Sea Lions include the California Sea Lion and Steller Sea Lion. 
        In comparison to Seals, Sea lions are able to walk on land, whereas their counterparts are not. They are currently endangered and protected by the MMPA (Marine Mammal Protection Act).
