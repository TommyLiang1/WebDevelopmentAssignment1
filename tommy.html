                <p>
                    <strong>Symbolism</strong>: The meaning of the white tiger has always intrigued people. The white tiger symbolizes spiritual enlightenment, extraordinary strength,
                    and unwavering courage. White tigers were revered by ancient Indians as symbols of bravery, strength, war, resolve, intuition, and clairvoyance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>: The white tiger is a result of a rare genetic mutation and the most efficient way to breed them is by using two tigers
                    who have the recessive genes needed to produce offspring with a white coat. In captive breeding facilities these two
                    individuals are often related, making inbreeding common.

                <p>
                    <strong>Area Located</strong>: It is reported in the wild from time to time in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha,

                    <strong>Symbolism</strong>: Gorilla symbolism and meaning includes strength, intelligence, communication, dignity, tranquility, gentleness, and
                    family. Native to the mountains and forests of central and west Africa, the gorilla fascinates those of us who feel a
                    strong kinship with these soulful primates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Gorillas can weigh over 200kg and stand as tall as an average human! Gorillas are mostly herbivores, which means they
                    only eat plants – up to 30kg of them per day! However, some subspecies have been known to eat insects and snails, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Area Located</strong>: The two gorilla species live in equatorial Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. Each has a
                    lowland and upland subspecies. Gorillas live in family groups of usually five to 10, but sometimes two to more than 50,
                    led by a dominant adult male—or silverback—who holds his position for years.
