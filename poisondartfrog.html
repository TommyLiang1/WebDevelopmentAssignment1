                The Poison Dart Frog is a species of frog native to Central and Southern America. It is considered one of, if not the most dangerous species of amphibians in the world, hence its name. 
                They typically range anywhere from 0.5 to 1 inch and have the ability to live for 3-15 years. These frogs are extremely colorful, ranging from greens to reds to blues to any bright color imaginable. 
                In the past, poison darts were made from the toxins released by these frogs. These frogs also never seem to use their toxins for anything other than self defense, off-putting their predator or dying alongside them.
