        stay in groups called "mobs". Some of these mobs can have over 50 kangaroos.

        <strong>Diet</strong>: Kangaroo are herbivores so they do not consume the meat of any other animal.
        They're main diet is grass. However, they are also known to eat forbs, ferns, flowers, fruit, moss and leaves of shrubs.

        <strong>Area Located</strong>: Kangaroos can mostly be found in the country of Australia although their original home was South America. 
        They can also be found in Tasmania and other nearby islands. 
        Other marsupials can be found in some parts of Asia and the Americas, though the continent of Australia has by far the most.

        Within Australia they can be found over most of the arid areas since they prefer flat and open planes.
