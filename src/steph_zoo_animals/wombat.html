        <strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Wombats main form of defense is their butt! Their butts are mostly made from 
        cartilage which makes it resistant to scratches and bites. They burrow into the ground and leave their butt 
        to block the hole. They also use their butts to sit on their enemies. 
      </p>

        <strong>Diet</strong>: wombats are herbivores, they stick to a strict plant-based diet.
        Wombats spend between 3 and 8 hours each night grazing on their favorite foods. This includes 
        mostly grass but also the sedges and the roots of shrubs and trees.
