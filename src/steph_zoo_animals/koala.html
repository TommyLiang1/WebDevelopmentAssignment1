        <strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Though Koalas may looks cute and harmless, they actually posess very powerful legs and sharp claws that make 
        it possible for them to climb trees. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Diet</strong>: Koalas are herbivores, they eat a variety of greens.
        They feast on a variety of eucalypt leaves and a few other related tree species, including lophostemon, melaleuca and corymbia species.
        This iscludes brush box, paperbark, and bloodwood trees!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Area Located</strong>: Koalas can only be found in the country of Australia. They are distributed across 
        Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and a small part of South Australia. 

        Though they can be found in all these locations, it may be harder now with their numbers dwindling. They are now an endangered species.
