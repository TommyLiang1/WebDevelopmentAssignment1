      <p>
        <strong>Symbolism</strong>: The meaning of the white tiger has always intrigued people. The white tiger
        symbolizes spiritual enlightenment, extraordinary strength,
        and unwavering courage. White tigers were revered by ancient Indians as symbols of bravery, strength,
        war, resolve, intuition, and clairvoyance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fun Fact</strong>: The white tiger is a result of a rare genetic mutation and the most efficient
        way to breed them is by using two tigers
        who have the recessive genes needed to produce offspring with a white coat. In captive breeding
        facilities these two
        individuals are often related, making inbreeding common.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Area Located</strong>: It is reported in the wild from time to time in the Indian states of
        Madhya Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha,
        in the Sunderbans region and especially in the former State of Rewa.
