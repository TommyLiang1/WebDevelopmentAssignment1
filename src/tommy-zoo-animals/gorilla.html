        <strong>Symbolism</strong>: Gorilla symbolism and meaning includes strength, intelligence,
        communication, dignity, tranquility, gentleness, and
        family. Native to the mountains and forests of central and west Africa, the gorilla fascinates those of
        us who feel a
        strong kinship with these soulful primates.

      <p>
        <strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Gorillas can weigh over 200kg and stand as tall as an average human! Gorillas
        are mostly herbivores, which means they
        only eat plants - up to 30kg of them per day! However, some subspecies have been known to eat insects
        and snails, too.

        <strong>Area Located</strong>: The two gorilla species live in equatorial Africa, separated by about 560
        miles of Congo Basin forest. Each has a
        lowland and upland subspecies. Gorillas live in family groups of usually five to 10, but sometimes two
        to more than 50,
        led by a dominant adult male—or silverback—who holds his position for years.
