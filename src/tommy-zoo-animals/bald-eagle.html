        <strong>Symbolism</strong>: Bald eagles, like other eagles worldwide, had been seen by many as symbols of strength, courage, freedom and immortality
        for generations. And, unlike other eagles, the bald eagle was indigenous only to North America. Some eagles have become
        notable in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fun Fact</strong>: 1. Eagles can fly up to 30 m.p.h. and can dive at speeds up to 100 m.p.h.
        2. Bald eagles develop the characteristic white head and tail feathers by 4-6 years of age.
        3. Fledgling eagles learn to fly at three months of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Area Located</strong>: Bald eagles are wholly North American, and currently are found in every state except Hawaii, as well as throughout
        Canada. Eagles prefer undisturbed areas near large lakes and reservoirs, marshes and swamps, or stretches along rivers
        where they can find open water and their primary food, fish.
