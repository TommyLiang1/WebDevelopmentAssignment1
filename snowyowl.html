                These owls are known for their snow white color and yellow eyes. They are often found in extremely cold climates in Northern America and the Arctics. 
                These owls have the ability to live anywhere from 10 years in the wild and up to 30 years when tamed. 
                Snowy Owls weigh anywhere from 3.5 - 7lbs, have a wingspan ranging from 4 to 5 feet, and are on average 2 feet tall. They are able to fly at speeds up to 46mph, almost as fast as a Lion(50mph) and Horse(55mph).
